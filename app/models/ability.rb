    ## Define abilities for the passed in user here. For example:
    ##
    ##   user ||= User.new # guest user (not logged in)
    ##   if user.admin?
    ##     can :manage, :all
    ##   else
    ##     can :read, :all
    ##   end
    ##
    ## The first argument to `can` is the action you are giving the user
    ## permission to do.
    ## If you pass :manage it will apply to every action. Other common actions
    ## here are :read, :create, :update and :destroy.
    ##
    ## The second argument is the resource the user can perform the action on.
    ## If you pass :all it will apply to every resource. Otherwise pass a Ruby
    ## class of the resource.
    ##
    ## The third argument is an optional hash of conditions to further filter the
    ## objects.
    ## For example, here the user can only update published articles.
    ##
    ##   can :update, Article, :published => true
    ##
